    "# Analysis of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you perform a \"measurement\" of some type and obtain \"scientific data\". You know what your data represents, but you have only a vague idea how different features in the data are connected, and what information you can extract from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would start first with going through the data, making sure your data set is complete and that the result is reasonable. Imagine this already happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step, you would inspect your data more closely and try to identify structures. That is the step that we are focusing on in this unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `data` folder, you will find several data files (`*.t` and `*.dat`). These are data files generated through some \"new approach\" that hasn't been used in your lab before. No previous analysis software exists, and you are going to establish a protocol for this \"new approach\" and \"publish your results\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be grouped into two categories: \n",
    "1. data to be analyzed using statistical methods;\n",
    "2. data to be analyzed using numerical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your hypothetical lab, you are an \"expert\" in one particular \"method\", and your co-worker is an \"expert\" in the other. Combined these two methods will lead to much more impactful results than if only one of you analyzed the data. Now, the task in this course is to be solved collaboratively with your team member working on one of the analysis approaches, and you working on the other. You will both implement functionality into the same piece of \"software\", but do so collaboratively through git.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you do not know yet which analysis is most meaningful for your data, and how to implement it, you will start with a jupyter notebook. You and your team member will work on the same notebook that will be part of a github repository for your project. This is the task for today. Discuss with your team members who will work on the statistical and who on the numerical analysis."
